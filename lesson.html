    <h1>Lesson: Spotting Fake Job Postings</h1>
    <p>
      Scammers often disguise themselves as legitimate employers. 
      By learning to recognize the signs, you can protect yourself and your peers.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Red Flags</h2>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Too good to be true:</strong> Unrealistic pay or benefits with little effort required.</li>
      <li><strong>Vague descriptions:</strong> No clear responsibilities or qualifications listed.</li>
      <li><strong>Off‑platform links:</strong> Requests to apply outside of Handshake or official channels.</li>
      <li><strong>Urgency tactics:</strong> “Apply immediately” or “limited spots” pressure language.</li>
      <li><strong>Weak online presence:</strong> Employer lacks a verified website or contact information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Falling for scams can expose your personal information, waste your time, 
      and even put your finances at risk. Recognizing these red flags early 
      ensures you stay safe and focus on legitimate opportunities.
